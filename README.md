### Create your own bot

The default bot strategy used is `creme332Strategy`. You can easily create your own bot by creating your strategy function inside `botController` and then calling it in the `main` function.

All code for the bot is found in `docs/pakupaku/bot.js`. 

## Game modifications
A few modifications were made to the original game to improve testing and readability:
- Turned off sound
- Turned off game replay
- Added a couple of comments

## Limitations
The `creme332Strategy` has several limitations:
- It can end up in a situation where it takes a very long time to eat the dots in the middle:

- It can move too close to the respawn point of the enemy and is unable to escape when enemy revives.

## To-do
- [ ] if distance between player and power up is small, go for powerup instead of fleeing
- [ ] Rewrite other algorithms using interface
- [ ] Improve `interface`:
    - [ ] add get functions for `eye` of enemy
    - [ ] add `powerTicks`
- [ ] Add more documentation for original game code in `main.js`
