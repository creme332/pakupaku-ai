### Create your own bot

The default bot strategy used is `creme332Strategy`. You can easily create your own bot by creating your strategy function inside `botController` and then calling it in the `main` function.

All code for the bot is found in `docs/pakupaku/bot.js`. 

## Limitations
The `creme332Strategy` has several limitations:
- It cannot consistently achieve the highest score.
- It can end up in a situation where it takes a very long time to eat the dots in the middle:

- It can move too close to an enemy when power is about to expire:

### Fixed âœ…
The following limitations are no longer present in the current version of `creme332Strategy` but might be useful when building your own bot:

- It can move too close to the respawn point of the enemy and is unable to escape when enemy revives.
